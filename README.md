# machineLearning_soccer_prediction_python

## About

This is a machine learning code written in Python, that uses the results of soccer games from the Brazilian Championship as a training model, to then use logistic regression to determine the result. The actual result is compared to the model in a confusion matrix.

## How to run

You can open ```machineLearning_soccer.ipynb``` for a glimpse on how it works. To run it, either use the .py file, or import the notebook on https://colab.research.google.com/. You'll need to download new data from http://www.football-data.co.uk in CSV, since the original file used is not available anymore.
